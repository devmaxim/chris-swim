          Moraga is a charming, affluent community built of spacious homes on tree-lined streets among the gently rolling hillsides of Contra Costa County. Just east of Orinda, Moraga is a family-oriented town with a rural feel. Schools here are excellent, with some of the highest scores in the state, and community support to match. Campolindo High School, which serves Moraga’s 1200 9th through 12th graders, was named a California Distinguished School, and scored over 900 on the CA API. Consequently the town is a magnet, drawing families with young children from the cities west of the Caldecott Tunnel who come here for the good schools, safe neighborhoods, warm weather and an escape from the urban grind.  Summer concerts take place in the Commons band shell. The town park has picnic area, a splash fountain where little kids frolic on hot days, bocce ball courts, a 9-hole disc-golf course, and a skate park where teenagers can drop in and grind. Moraga’s historic Rheem Theater has been reborn as a community movie palace showing Hollywood blockbusters and independent films. Nearby Saint Mary’s College, on a 420-acre campus, offers a series of programs for the community, including a creative writing series, theater and dance performances as well as exhibitions at The Hearst Art Gallery.

          Moraga has fought hard to preserve its open space. Cows still graze and horses wander the hills outside town. The 7-mile Moraga-Lafayette Trail is popular with runners and bikers.
