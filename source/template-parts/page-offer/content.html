                <h2>Determining Value</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                Price is one of the most significant factors potential buyers consider when looking at a property. You do not want your valuable investment to be either under-priced or over-priced - but how do you know what is appropriate? How can you tell what the market will respond to? We will help you realize the optimum value of your property. As your real estate agent, we will:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prepare and review a comparable market analysis. This will help determine a pricing strategy for your property. We may recommend obtaining certain inspection reports prior to marketing and review the impact they have on pricing.</li>
                <li>Provide you with updates on market activity, including:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Newly available comparable properties.</li>
                  <li>Recent sales of any comparable properties.</li>
                  <li>Price reductions on available comparable properties.</li>
                  <li>Expired or canceled listings of comparable properties.</li>
                  <li>Communication from other sales agents and potential purchasers.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Outline your options and make recommendations based on market conditions and your personal situation.</li>
                <li>Review the pricing strategy as needed.</li>

              </header>
              <p>
                First Impressions count. Before inviting buyers into your property, you'll want to be sure you've done everything to make it as attractive as possible. There are many ways to improve your chances of a sale. As your real estate agent, we will:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Advise you as to how to present your property. This may include recommendations for cosmetic changes such as painting, landscaping, and arranging the best way to 'stage' your property for a visit from a potential buyer.</li>
                <li>Advise you as to whether to obtain a professional inspection prior to placing your property on the market. An inspection generally presents a clear picture of the physical condition of the property and allows us to anticipate issues that may arise during the transaction. (This is not intended to preclude buyers from obtaining their own inspections.)</li>
